# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio – Abdulrazzak Swai

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I’m a passionate cybersecurity student and self-driven learner, focused on SOC analysis, penetration testing, and web development. I spend most of my time learning, practicing, and refining my skills through hands-on platforms like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, and **TCM Security**.

This site is designed to showcase my background, experiences, education, and personal projects, while also reflecting my efforts to transform cybersecurity education at my university—from traditional theory to **gamified, practical learning** that prepares students for the real world.
