Welcome to my legacy **personal website!** I’m a detail-oriented **cybersecurity student** and **self-driven learner**, focused on **SOC analysis**, **penetration testing**, and **web development**. I spent most of my time **learning**, **practicing**, and refining my skills through **hands-on platforms** like **Hack The Box**, **TryHackMe**, **TCM Security**, and **freeCodeCamp**, while also building **projects** to strengthen my **technical skills**.

This website previously showcased my **background**, **education**, and **personal projects**, and reflected my efforts to transform cybersecurity education at my university, from traditional theory to **gamified, practical learning** that prepares students for the real world.

## 🎯 Education Philosophy

I am committed to **shifting perspectives on learning** by promoting **practical skills** and **online certifications** as equal **or greater in value** than traditional academic education. Through my journey, I strive to demonstrate that **success is achievable independently of traditional theory, MCQ-based exams, and conventional academic paths**.
